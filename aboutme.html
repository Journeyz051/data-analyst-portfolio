    <h1>Professional Introduction</h1>
    <p> Throughout my work experience, in many different types of positions, I've demonstrated resilience and determination in overcoming challenges. I thrive when faced with complex problems and consistently seek out opportunities to expand my knowledge and skillset. My natural curiosity to know more has been my driving force in my professional development.
        I have keen skills in critical thinking, attention to detail, proficient organization, seeing patterns and collaborative problem-solving. I'm eager to apply these and many more capabilities in data analytics to make meaningful contributions to your organization. 
        My background has instilled in me a way to see the big picture, I work well in many environments and a variety of different groups. There is no task too small to do, and always willing to learn the next thing. I have a strong work ethic, exceptional communication skills, and the ability to perform effectively in high-pressure environments—all qualities that transfer seamlessly to this new professional direction.
        I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my diverse experience, coupled with my current technical training, can benefit your team as I embark on this exciting new chapter in my career.

    <h2>An Outdoor Enthusiast!</h2>
    <p>I'm an avid outdoor enthusiast who finds both joy and personal growth through cycling, mountain biking, hiking, and trail running. These pursuits have not only kept me physically active but have profoundly shaped my approach to challenges in all areas of life.
        Navigating difficult terrain on a mountain bike or pushing through the final miles of a challenging road ride has built my resilience and determination. Just as I've learned to adapt to changing conditions on the trail—whether it's unexpected weather, technical descents, or steep climbs—I bring this same adaptability and perseverance to my professional endeavors.
        My time in nature has instilled in me a deep appreciation for both setting ambitious goals and enjoying the journey along the way. This balanced perspective helps me stay focused and motivated while maintaining the flexibility needed to thrive in dynamic environments.
        AND, on top of all the wonderful energy, life and drive I get from being physically active, my next favorite thing to do after I have exerted all that energy is to dig into those STATS! All my data that has been analyzed and put into visualization charts, I love to see what I accomplished, how it compares to other similar activities, how I can get better, ride longer, or find other trails.
