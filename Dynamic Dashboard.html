        This dashboard is a representation of the Stats for NHL for 2021 - 2022. In the dashboard one can choose to sort the column chart by Category, Metric and Team by High to Low or Low to High. Below the column chart one can sort the category by up to 6 six players and also see the high score highlighted in gold.
        Below that chart, I created a pivot table with slicers to look at Category and Metric by Team and Position. I gathered the information using a data_dictionary and dataset. I created a wireframe for plotting out the dashboard. I created a TeamFiltered table and a unique filter for TeamFiltered to make the dropdown's only pull the Team associated players.
        Then I created a sheet for Lists. This Lists is of Players and their Teams, plus Categores and Metrics to help with other dropdowns on the dashboard.

        If you enjoy watching the National Hockey League then I hope you enjoy this dynamic dashboard.
